## Breaking Changes

### Removed `decompose_goal_into_behaviors` MCP tool

Server-side goal-string-splitting is removed. The orchestrator now decomposes via LLM reasoning and creates each entity individually through `tdd_goal_create` and `tdd_behavior_create`. Callers using the old tool will get an unknown-procedure error from the MCP router.

### `tdd_phase_transition_request` requires `goalId` and an explicit `red` phase

The input schema gains a required `goalId: number`. Existing callers that pass only `tddSessionId`, `requestedPhase`, and `citedArtifactId` will fail validation. Pass the parent goal's id alongside; the tool now also pre-validates that the goal status is `in_progress` and that any cited `behaviorId` belongs to the named goal.

Additionally, transitions to `green` are now rejected unless the current phase is `red`, `red.triangulate`, or `green.fake-it`. Callers that previously relied on `spike→green` or `refactor→green` "free transitions" will receive a `wrong_source_phase` denial with a remediation hint pointing at `requestedPhase: "red"`. The `red` phase must now be an explicit named DB row in every TDD cycle.

### Reshaped `tdd_session_behaviors` schema

The behaviors table no longer has `parent_tdd_session_id`, `child_tdd_session_id`, or `depends_on_behavior_ids`. It now references the new `tdd_session_goals` table via `goal_id NOT NULL`, with dependencies stored in a separate `tdd_behavior_dependencies` junction table. `tdd_phases.behavior_id` cascade changed from `SET NULL` to `CASCADE`. `tdd_artifacts` gains a `behavior_id` column for behavior-scoped queries. Pre-2.0 dev databases must be wiped on first pull (the migration ledger has no content hash, so editing `0002_comprehensive` in place does not auto-replay).

### Removed `writeTddSessionBehaviors` from DataStore

The batch behavior-insert path is gone alongside the tool that drove it. Use `createBehavior` per behavior instead.

## Features

### Three-tier goal/behavior hierarchy

`vitest-agent-sdk` defines the new entity tiers. `tdd_session_goals` stores coherent slices of an objective; `tdd_session_behaviors` stores atomic red-green-refactor units under a goal; `tdd_behavior_dependencies` records ordering constraints without JSON-in-TEXT. Status lifecycle is `pending → in_progress → done | abandoned`; deletes are reserved for cleanup of mistakes and `abandoned` is the normal way to drop work.

### 10 new MCP CRUD tools

- `tdd_goal_create` (idempotent on `(sessionId, goal)`), `tdd_goal_get`, `tdd_goal_update`, `tdd_goal_delete`, `tdd_goal_list`.
- `tdd_behavior_create` (idempotent on `(goalId, behavior)`), `tdd_behavior_get`, `tdd_behavior_update`, `tdd_behavior_delete`, `tdd_behavior_list` (discriminated input: `{ scope: "goal" | "session", ... }`).
- Read tools return the full nested shape (goals with nested behaviors; behaviors with parentGoal summary and dependency list) so an agent can analyze a session in one round trip.
- Errors return as `{ ok: false, error: { _tag, ..., remediation } }` success-shape envelopes — never tRPC error envelopes.

### Tagged error API for goal/behavior CRUD

`vitest-agent-sdk` exports `GoalNotFoundError`, `BehaviorNotFoundError`, `TddSessionNotFoundError`, `TddSessionAlreadyEndedError`, and `IllegalStatusTransitionError`. Each carries a derived message and is surfaced through the MCP envelope shape with a remediation hint pointing the caller at the right recovery tool.

### `tdd_session_get` renders Goals and Behaviors

When a session has `tdd_session_goals` and `tdd_session_behaviors` rows, `tdd_session_get` now renders a `## Goals and Behaviors` section beneath Phases and Artifacts. Each goal is listed with its 1-based ordinal and text; each behavior is nested under its parent goal with its current status.

### Auto-promote behavior status on phase transition

When `tdd_phase_transition_request` accepts a transition with a `behaviorId` and the behavior is currently `pending`, the server auto-promotes it to `in_progress`. Callers do not need a separate `tdd_behavior_update` for the start-of-cycle transition; only the final `done` transition.

### `ChannelEvent` schema union

`vitest-agent-sdk` defines a typed union over the 13 orchestrator → main-agent progress events: `goals_ready`, `goal_added`, `goal_started`, `goal_completed` (with `behaviorIds[]` for order-independent rendering), `goal_abandoned`, `behaviors_ready`, `behavior_added`, `behavior_started`, `phase_transition`, `behavior_completed`, `behavior_abandoned`, `blocked`, and `session_complete` (with `goalIds[]`). `tdd_progress_push` validates payloads against this union and resolves `goalId` / `sessionId` server-side from `behaviorId` for behavior-scoped events so a stale orchestrator context cannot push the wrong tree coordinates.

### Orchestrator restricted-tools hook

`vitest-agent-plugin` ships `pre-tool-use-tdd-restricted.sh`, a PreToolUse hook scoped to the TDD orchestrator subagent that denies `tdd_goal_delete`, `tdd_behavior_delete`, and `tdd_artifact_record` with a remediation hint pointing at `status: 'abandoned'`. Defense-in-depth — the orchestrator's `tools[]` frontmatter is a soft enumeration; the hook is the runtime gate. Delete tools are also intentionally omitted from the auto-allow list so main-agent calls require explicit user confirmation before a cascade.

### Three-tier task list rendering

The main-agent skill (`plugin/skills/tdd/SKILL.md`) takes ownership of channel-event handling and renders the goal+behavior hierarchy flat with `[G<n>.B<m>]` label encoding (Claude Code's `TaskCreate` does not nest cleanly past one parent). Goals appear as marker tasks (`--- Goal N done ---`) inserted between behavior groups. `goal_completed` and `session_complete` carry reconciliation arrays so the renderer is order-independent against dropped intermediate events.

## Refactoring

### Single-statement ordinal allocation

`createGoal` and `createBehavior` allocate ordinals via a single `INSERT ... SELECT COALESCE(MAX(ordinal), -1) + 1 ...` statement so concurrent inserts under one parent never collide without needing `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`.

### Status validation in DataStore boundary

Goal and behavior status transitions are validated at the DataStore service tag (typed `IllegalStatusTransitionError`) rather than via SQL triggers. Triggers would surface as raw `SqlError`, defeating the "errors are typed and carry remediation" design principle.
