# Architecture — `vitest-agent`

`vitest-agent` is a Vitest reporter, plugin, CLI and MCP server family that
captures test execution data into a SQLite database and exposes it to LLM
coding agents. A test run produces persisted runs, failures, coverage,
TDD lifecycle state and session/turn history; agents read that data through
the MCP server, the CLI or the file-based Claude Code plugin. This document
is the front door — load the sub-files below for the specifics.

The system is shaped around three layers stacked in importance: token
reduction in the reporter (necessary, not sufficient), persisted data in
SQLite (so failures are actionable across runs), and the Claude Code plugin's
TDD orchestrator (what turns the data into reliable agent behavior). The
agent+data+TDD loop is slower per cycle than ungated prompting, but it is
reliable enough that lower-tier subagents (Sonnet) succeed against tasks
dispatched by a stronger main model.

For the consumer, the integration is one install: add `vitest-agent-plugin`
to a project, register `agentPlugin()` in `vitest.config.ts`, and install
the Claude Code plugin from the marketplace. The lockstep peers pull in the
reporter, CLI and MCP packages; the hook chain wires up; the MCP server is
launched on demand by the user's package manager. No runtime configuration
beyond the plugin call.

## Package landscape

The project is a pnpm monorepo. Five publishable workspaces under
`packages/` plus a file-based Claude Code plugin at `plugin/` (not a
workspace).

| Workspace | Path | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `vitest-agent-sdk` | `packages/sdk/` | Shared base. Schemas, migrations, errors, services, layers, formatters, the XDG path-resolution stack, the public reporter contract types. No internal dependencies. |
| `vitest-agent-plugin` | `packages/plugin/` | The Vitest plugin. Owns the Vitest lifecycle, persistence, classification, baselines and trends. Delegates rendering to a reporter factory. |
| `vitest-agent-reporter` | `packages/reporter/` | Named `VitestAgentReporterFactory` implementations. No Vitest-API code. |
| `vitest-agent-cli` | `packages/cli/` | The `vitest-agent` bin. Read-side commands plus the hook-driven `record` subcommand. |
| `vitest-agent-mcp` | `packages/mcp/` | The `vitest-agent-mcp` bin. tRPC tool router, MCP resources, MCP prompts. |
| `plugin/` (file-based) | `plugin/` | Claude Code plugin distributed via the marketplace as `vitest-agent@spencerbeggs`. Hooks, the TDD orchestrator subagent, slash commands, sub-skill primitives, the MCP loader. |

The five npm workspaces release in lockstep. `vitest-agent-plugin` declares
`vitest-agent-reporter`, `vitest-agent-cli` and `vitest-agent-mcp` as
required `peerDependencies`; all four runtime packages pin
`vitest-agent-sdk` at `workspace:*`.

For per-package internals, load the matching file under
[./components/](./components/) via the [./components.md](./components.md)
index.

## How the pieces fit

At runtime there is one shared SQLite database (`data.db`) at a
deterministic XDG-derived path. Three independent processes touch it:

- **The Vitest plugin** runs inside `vitest run`. `agentPlugin()` from
  `vitest-agent-plugin` injects an internal `AgentReporter` Vitest-API
  class via `configureVitest`. After tests finish, the reporter persists
  the run, computes classifications and trends, then hands a
  `ReporterKit` to a user-supplied `VitestAgentReporterFactory`. The
  factory returns one or more `VitestAgentReporter`s; their
  `RenderedOutput[]` is concatenated and routed to stdout, the GitHub
  Step Summary file or another target. The default factory lives in
  `vitest-agent-reporter`.
- **The `vitest-agent` CLI** is a short-lived `@effect/cli` process. It
  resolves the same `dbPath` and reads cached data through `DataReader`.
  The `record` subcommand is the only writer on the CLI side; it is
  driven by the Claude Code plugin's hooks.
- **The `vitest-agent-mcp` server** is a long-lived stdio process built
  on `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`. It opens the same database under a
  `ManagedRuntime` and exposes a tRPC tool router for read and write
  operations, plus MCP resources (vendored Vitest docs and a curated
  patterns library) and framing-only prompts.

The Claude Code plugin sits above all three. Its loader spawns the MCP
server through the user's package manager, its hooks invoke
`vitest-agent record` for session and turn capture, and its subagent and
skills turn the captured data into agent behavior. The npm packages
collect and store; the Claude Code plugin interprets.

The shared `vitest-agent-sdk` package is what makes this single-database
story work: every package depends on the same schemas, the same
`DataStore`/`DataReader` services and the same path resolver, so all
three processes converge on the same `data.db` from the same workspace
identity.

## Where to load next

| When you need to understand... | Load |
| --- | --- |
| a specific component or package | [./components.md](./components.md) — index pointing at the per-package sub-file |
| why a design choice has its current shape | [./decisions.md](./decisions.md) |
| what shape data takes (TS types, Effect Schemas, SQLite tables, reporter contract) | [./schemas.md](./schemas.md) |
| how data moves end to end (reporter, CLI, MCP, plugin spawn, idempotency) | [./data-flows.md](./data-flows.md) |
| where files live, the XDG data-path stack, package-manager detection | [./file-structure.md](./file-structure.md) |
| testing patterns, per-project counts, coverage targets | [./testing-strategy.md](./testing-strategy.md) |
| a retired or superseded decision | [./decisions-retired.md](./decisions-retired.md) |

The Claude Code plugin's internals (hooks, subagent, dogfood workflow)
live in [./components/plugin-claude.md](./components/plugin-claude.md).

## Key principles

- **Effect-first.** All I/O lives behind Effect services with live and
  test layer pairs. Domain shapes are Effect Schemas, re-exported from
  `vitest-agent-sdk`. Zod is reserved for tRPC tool input validation in
  the MCP package.
- **Lockstep release.** The five npm packages share one version — a bump
  to any one bumps all five. The plugin pins the reporter, CLI and MCP
  packages as required `peerDependencies`, so consumers install only
  `vitest-agent-plugin` and the peers pull in the rest at the matching
  version. The Claude Code plugin can lag the npm packages. Runtime
  version sync is verifiable through `process.env.__PACKAGE_VERSION__`,
  which `rslib-builder` inlines into each package's bundle as a string at
  build time; an inlined-at-build constant avoids a runtime `package.json`
  read and surfaces a mismatch loudly when the invariant is broken (a
  hand-mixed install, a forgotten lockstep release).
- **One shared database, deterministic path.** `data.db` lives at
  `$XDG_DATA_HOME/vitest-agent/<workspaceKey>/data.db` (with the usual
  XDG fallback). The path is a function of workspace identity, not
  filesystem layout. Resolution fails loudly with
  `WorkspaceRootNotFoundError` rather than hashing a directory. See
  [./file-structure.md](./file-structure.md).
- **Plugin owns lifecycle, reporter owns rendering.** The
  `VitestAgentReporter` contract is a single synchronous `render(input)`
  returning `ReadonlyArray<RenderedOutput>`. Multi-target output (e.g.
  console plus GitHub Step Summary) composes by returning multiple
  reporters from a factory, not by special-casing the plugin.
- **The Claude Code plugin is the AI integration surface.** The npm
  packages are headless data infrastructure. The file-based plugin at
  `plugin/` is what turns that data into agent behavior — hooks for
  session/turn capture, the TDD orchestrator subagent, the slash
  commands and the MCP loader. It ships separately through the Claude
  marketplace.

## Current limitations

- Output is written post-run in `onTestRunEnd`, not streamed during
  execution.
- Coverage is shared across projects within a single Vitest run; only
  the first project alphabetically processes the global `CoverageMap`.
- File-to-test mapping is convention-based (`.test.`/`.spec.` strip);
  there is no import-graph analysis.
- The `RenderedOutput` `file` target is a reserved no-op; current
  routing dispatches `stdout` and `github-summary` only.
- Standalone `AgentReporter` usage from 1.x is gone. Consumers must
  install `vitest-agent-plugin` and use `agentPlugin()`; the reporter
  package no longer exports a Vitest-API class.
