# Components — `vitest-agent`

The system ships as five pnpm workspaces under `packages/` plus a file-based
Claude Code plugin at `plugin/`. This document is an index — load the
sub-file for the package you're working on.

**Parent document:** [./architecture.md](./architecture.md)

## Sub-files

| File | Load when working on |
| ---- | -------------------- |
| [./components/sdk.md](./components/sdk.md) | services, layers, schemas, DataStore/DataReader, migrations, path resolution, formatters, the public reporter contract types, utilities |
| [./components/plugin.md](./components/plugin.md) | `AgentPlugin`, the internal `AgentReporter` lifecycle class, `CoverageAnalyzer`, reporter-side utilities, coverage threshold extraction |
| [./components/reporter.md](./components/reporter.md) | named `VitestAgentReporterFactory` implementations, the `_kit-context.ts` helper, `defaultReporter` composition |
| [./components/cli.md](./components/cli.md) | CLI commands, the `record` subcommand and its hook-driven actions, `CliLive` |
| [./components/mcp.md](./components/mcp.md) | MCP tools, idempotency middleware, channel-event resolution, MCP resources, MCP prompts, the snapshot maintenance pipeline, `McpLive` |
| [./components/plugin-claude.md](./components/plugin-claude.md) | the Claude Code plugin: hooks, the TDD orchestrator agent, skills, slash commands, the dogfood system, the MCP loader |

Each sub-file is self-contained for its package and cross-references
[./decisions.md](./decisions.md) and [./data-structures.md](./data-structures.md)
where the rationale or schema details live.
