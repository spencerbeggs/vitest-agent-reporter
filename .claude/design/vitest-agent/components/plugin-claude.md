# Claude Code Plugin (`plugin/`)

The Claude Code plugin at `plugin/` is the primary AI integration surface for the
vitest-agent system. The five npm packages collect and store data; this plugin
turns that data into agent behavior — through hook scripts, a TDD orchestrator
subagent, sub-skill primitives, slash commands, and an MCP loader.

The plugin is a **file-based Claude Code plugin**, not a pnpm workspace and not
published to npm. It ships through the Claude marketplace as
`vitest-agent@spencerbeggs` and versions independently from the npm packages.
Child context for working in the tree lives at `plugin/CLAUDE.md`.

For decisions that shaped this design, see
[../decisions.md](../decisions.md): D20 (file-based plugin),
D30 (PM-detect spawn loader), D34 (plugin/reporter split),
D11 (TDD evidence binding), D12 (three-tier hierarchy), D13
(capability-vs-scoping doctrine).

## Overview

The plugin sits between Claude Code and the user's project. Claude Code reads
the plugin manifest, spawns the MCP loader, registers hook scripts, and exposes
the TDD orchestrator agent and slash commands. The plugin contributes nothing
to the user's runtime — every script and prompt is consumed by Claude Code
itself.

### Why this is the keystone

The npm packages are headless data infrastructure: the reporter trims output,
the SDK persists runs and failures, the MCP server exposes them. None of that
on its own changes how an agent writes code. This plugin is the integration
surface that turns the persisted data into agent behavior.

The TDD orchestrator (`agents/tdd-task.md`) is the core of that translation.
It runs red-green-refactor cycles against the user's tests with hard MCP gates
at every phase boundary, with phase-transition evidence binding (Decision D11)
that prevents the drift ungated agent TDD typically produces — citing the
wrong test, citing a test that was already failing on main, citing tests
authored in a previous session, claiming "green" without ever entering "red".
The three-tier Objective→Goal→Behavior hierarchy (Decision D12) gives the
orchestrator a stable navigation axis for decomposition and for the channel
events it streams back to the dispatching agent. Token reduction in the
reporter and persisted data in SQLite are necessary preconditions; this is
what makes them load-bearing.

## Current State

### Loader strategy

`bin/start-mcp.sh` is a POSIX shell loader that Claude Code spawns as a direct
child process over stdio. It is intentionally tiny and dependency-free: it must
run before the user has installed anything.

The loader has three responsibilities:

1. Resolve `projectDir` from `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` (or `pwd`).
2. Detect the project's package manager — first the `packageManager` field in
   `package.json`, then lockfile presence (`pnpm-lock.yaml`, `yarn.lock`,
   `bun.lock`, defaulting to npm).
3. `exec` into `<pm exec> vitest-agent-mcp`, replacing itself.

The `exec` is load-bearing. After startup, Claude Code's direct child is the
package manager process — there is no shell wrapper hanging around to forward
signals or buffer stdio. When Claude Code closes the session pipe, the MCP
server exits via EOF. No orphan processes. A Node-based loader (`start-mcp.mjs`)
exists as a fallback for debugging but is not the active loader unless
`plugin.json` is changed to reference it.

`VITEST_AGENT_REPORTER_PROJECT_DIR` is exported into the spawned MCP server's
environment. This passthrough exists because Claude Code does not reliably
propagate `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` to MCP server subprocesses; the MCP server reads
this env var as the highest-precedence source for `projectDir` resolution. The
SDK package and MCP server both share this contract — see D30 for the full
rationale.

The MCP server itself is **not bundled** with the plugin. It is a peer of
`vitest-agent-plugin` in the user's project and is resolved by the user's PM at
spawn time. Bundling was rejected because the SDK depends on `better-sqlite3`,
a native module that must match the user's platform and Node version. See
D29 (retired) for the dynamic-import approach this replaced.

The PM-walk is also load-bearing for the lockstep release invariant
(Decision 36). The MCP server must run from the consumer's installation
context so the version-pinned peer dep on `vitest-agent-mcp` resolves to
the same release as the `vitest-agent-plugin` that wired up the reporter.
A global `npx vitest-agent-mcp` invocation (or any spawn rooted outside
the user's package manager) would resolve against an arbitrary version
and silently drift from the plugin's expected SDK contract. The CLI is
directory-bound for the same reason.

### Hook architecture

Hooks register against Claude Code's lifecycle events through `hooks/hooks.json`.
Every hook script is POSIX shell, sources shared helpers from `hooks/lib/`, and
returns JSON to Claude Code via stdout. Hooks fall into four functional
categories:

- **Recording hooks.** Capture session, prompt, tool-call, file-edit, and
  hook-fire turns into the SQLite database via `vitest-agent record`. These
  drive session analytics and the wrap-up nudges. They run on every event,
  unscoped — every turn in every session is captured.
- **Context-injection hooks.** Run on `SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit`,
  `Stop`, `SessionEnd`, and `PreCompact`, calling the `triage` and `wrapup`
  CLIs and emitting their output back to Claude Code as session context or
  `systemMessage`. Per Claude Code's hook schema, `additionalContext` is only
  valid for a subset of events; `Stop`, `SessionEnd`, and `PreCompact` must
  use top-level `systemMessage` instead.
- **Permission hooks.** `pre-tool-use-mcp.sh` reads `tool_name` against the
  allowlist at `hooks/lib/safe-mcp-vitest-agent-ops.txt` and emits
  `permissionDecision: "allow"` for non-destructive MCP tools so the agent
  doesn't see a confirmation prompt for every read. Destructive tools
  (`tdd_goal_delete`, `tdd_behavior_delete`, `tdd_artifact_record`) are
  intentionally absent so they fall through to Claude Code's standard
  permission dialog.
- **TDD orchestrator gates.** A subset of hooks fire only when the
  orchestrator subagent is active. They block production-code edits without
  preceding test failures, deny dangerous Vitest flags (`--update`,
  `--bail`, `--testNamePattern`), reject test-weakening edits, and record
  evidence artifacts. This is the runtime enforcement layer for the iron-law
  TDD discipline; the agent's `tools[]` array is documentation.

The match-tdd-agent helper at `hooks/lib/match-tdd-agent.sh` is the load-bearing
piece for orchestrator scoping. Claude Code emits the subagent identity in the
hook envelope's `agent_type` field — Claude Code currently sends the value
`"vitest-agent:tdd-task"`, and that is the only form matched. Legacy forms
(`"plugin:vitest-agent:tdd-task"`, bare `"tdd-task"`) were removed after they
were confirmed never observed in practice. All orchestrator-scoped hooks gate
through the shared `is_tdd_agent` function so the matching logic lives in one
place. If Claude Code's identity format changes, this is the only file that
needs updating.

Hook scripts source a shared logging helper at `hooks/lib/hook-debug.sh` that
provides two logging functions. `hook_error` always appends to
`/tmp/vitest-agent-hook-errors.log` (overrideable via
`VITEST_AGENT_HOOK_ERROR_LOG`); CLI failures in recording and artifact hooks
write here instead of being silently swallowed. `hook_debug` appends to
`/tmp/vitest-agent-hook-debug.log` (overrideable via
`VITEST_AGENT_HOOK_DEBUG_LOG`) but only when `VITEST_AGENT_HOOK_DEBUG=1` is
set. Recording and artifact hooks use a structured capture-and-log pattern: CLI
output is captured, exit status is tested, and failures call `hook_error` before
the hook exits — the previous pattern of appending `|| true` to silence errors
is gone.

The allowlist file at `hooks/lib/safe-mcp-vitest-agent-ops.txt` is plain text:
one operation suffix per line, blank lines and `#` comments stripped before
exact matching. New non-destructive MCP tools must be added here when
deployed; delete tools must remain absent. The file's comment header explains
this constraint to any agent editing it.

### Evidence binding

The TDD enforcement loop depends on `tdd_artifacts` rows being written
**by hooks, not by the orchestrator**. This is Decision D7's core constraint:
the agent never writes evidence about itself — hooks observe what the agent did
and write the artifact rows. `tdd_artifact_record` is intentionally not an MCP
tool.

`post-tool-use-tdd-artifact.sh` fires on every tool result inside the
orchestrator subagent. It detects:

- **Test runs** by matching the Bash command against
  `(vitest|jest)|(npm|pnpm|yarn|bun) (run )?(test|vitest)`. Exit code 0 yields
  a `test_passed_run` artifact; non-zero yields `test_failed_run`.
- **File edits** by tool name. Edits to `*.test.*` paths produce
  `test_written`; edits to anything else produce `code_written`.
- **Test-weakening edits** in a separate hook (`post-tool-use-test-quality.sh`)
  by scanning for escape-hatch tokens (`it.skip`, `.todo`, `.fails`, snapshot
  edits, etc.) and writing `test_weakened` artifacts.

Before writing each artifact, the hook calls `vitest-agent record
test-case-turns` to backfill `test_cases.created_turn_id` and capture the
latest `test_case_id` for the session. This binds every artifact to a test
case if one was authored in the same session window.

The `test_case_authored_in_session` constraint is the load-bearing invariant.
The phase-transition validator (Decision D11) requires that a cited test
artifact's test case was authored in the **current session** — not pulled from
historical runs, not authored by a different agent. Without this constraint,
an agent could cite any failing test from history to claim "I'm in red,"
defeating the iron law. The constraint is enforced at validation time
(`packages/sdk/src/utils/validate-phase-transition.ts`), but it relies on the
hook layer correctly stamping `test_case_authored_in_session = true` only when
the test was actually authored in the current session's window.

The file-filter approach — matching test runs by command shape rather than
process inspection — is a deliberate choice. PostToolUse fires after the Bash
result is already captured by Claude Code; there is no live process to
inspect. Pattern matching against the user's command string is the only signal
available, and it has to cover every package manager Vitest can be invoked
through.

For the channel event schema and `tdd_artifacts` row schema, see
[../data-structures.md](../data-structures.md) — channel event section and
SQLite table inventory respectively.

### Agent architecture

The plugin ships one agent: `agents/tdd-task.md`, the TDD orchestrator. Its job
is to drive red-green-refactor cycles against the user's tests, with hard MCP
gates at session start, before every non-test edit, and at every phase
boundary. The full prompt — iron law, eight-state state machine, three-tier
hierarchy, channel event table, restricted Bash list — is in the agent file.

**Three-tier hierarchy.** The orchestrator decomposes its `goal` argument into
goals (slices testable as units), then each goal into behaviors (one
red-green-refactor cycle each). This is the user-facing structure of TDD work
and is the primary navigation axis for the channel events the orchestrator
pushes back to the main agent. Goals and behaviors are first-class storage —
each has its own row, status lifecycle, and CRUD surface. Decomposition is the
LLM's job; the server stores what it's told and validates referential
integrity. See D12 for the full rationale on why server-side regex splitting
was retired.

**The `context: fork` decision.** The orchestrator runs in a forked
conversation context — it does not inherit the dispatching agent's history.
Task prompts must be self-contained. This is correct in two distinct usage
modes:

- **Production use.** The orchestrator should reason from its prompt, not from
  the dispatcher's accumulated state. A user asking the main agent to "fix the
  failing tests in module X" should produce a task prompt the orchestrator
  can execute against any clean context — the dispatcher's prior work shapes
  the prompt, but the orchestrator works against the prompt alone.
- **Dogfood use.** The dispatcher's context contains the cheatsheet and the
  meta-goal of the dogfood session — both invisible to the orchestrator. Fork
  prevents leakage. See "Dogfood system" below.

The trade-off is that the dispatcher must construct a complete task prompt
every time. There is no "remember what we discussed" path. Hook-injected
context (session-start triage, MCP tool reference) compensates for this by
giving every dispatch the same baseline awareness of the project's test
state.

**Pre-dispatch sequence.** Before spawning the orchestrator, the main agent
calls `session_list({ agentKind: "main", limit: 1 })` to capture the
`cc_session_id` from the DB row — not `get_current_session_id()`, which can
hold a stale in-memory reference if a prior subagent called
`set_current_session_id` with its own key. The agent then calls `TaskCreate` to
create the parent `TDD Session: <objective>` task and initializes the
`goalById` and `behaviorById` state maps before spawning.

**Channel-event flow.** When the orchestrator hits a lifecycle transition
(goal/behavior created, started, phase changed, completed, abandoned, blocked,
session complete), it calls `tdd_progress_push` with a typed payload. The MCP
server validates the payload against the `ChannelEvent` discriminated union,
**resolves `goalId` and `sessionId` server-side from `behaviorId`** for
behavior-scoped events, and forwards the event to the main agent through
Claude Code's notification channel. The main agent's `tdd` skill renders the
events as a flat task panel with `[G<n>.B<m>]` labels (Claude Code's
`TaskCreate` doesn't nest cleanly past one parent).

The server-side ID resolution exists so that a stale orchestrator context
cannot push the wrong tree coordinates — even if the orchestrator's mental
model of the goal/behavior hierarchy drifts, the MCP server resolves
coordinates from the database. Resolution is best-effort; malformed JSON or
DB read failures fall through with the original payload.

**`behaviors_ready` deferral.** When the main agent receives a `behaviors_ready`
channel event, it records each behavior's ordinals in `behaviorById` but does
**not** call `TaskCreate` yet. Task creation is deferred to `behavior_started`
so that abandoned sessions — which fire `behaviors_ready` but never
`behavior_started` — do not leave orphaned pending tasks in the task panel.
This is why the `tdd` skill's event-handler table specifies "No tasks yet" for
both `behaviors_ready` and `behavior_added`.

The `tools[]` enumeration on the orchestrator is documentation, not
enforcement. The runtime gate that prevents `tdd_goal_delete` and
`tdd_behavior_delete` calls inside the orchestrator is
`pre-tool-use-tdd-restricted.sh`. See D13 for the full
"capability-vs-scoping" doctrine: the MCP surface permits the operation; the
agent layer restricts who may call it.

### Skills

The plugin ships skill primitives covering every step of the TDD cycle:
interpreting failures, naming and shaping tests, verifying test quality,
running and classifying results, recording hypotheses before fixes,
committing at green and refactor exit, reverting on extended red, and
decomposing goals into behaviors. All primitives are also referenced by the
orchestrator's `skills:` frontmatter so they are preloaded on dispatch.

Higher-level skills (`tdd`, `debugging`, `coverage-improvement`,
`configuration`, `vitest-context`) are available standalone for the main agent
to load on demand. The `tdd` skill in particular owns the channel-event
handler — it is what renders the orchestrator's `tdd_progress_push` events
into the user-visible task panel.

Per D6, primitives are single-source-of-truth: the orchestrator agent
preloads them via frontmatter, and they are also published as standalone
`SKILL.md` files for non-orchestrator reuse. There is no separate copy of the
primitive content embedded inline.

### Slash commands

`/setup` and `/configure` are scaffolding helpers for adding `AgentPlugin` to a
project's Vitest config. `/tdd` launches a TDD session by dispatching the
orchestrator with the user's goal as the task prompt — the command does
nothing beyond forwarding the goal; all the real work is in the agent.

### Dogfood system

The dogfood system is how the plugin's behavior under load is verified. The
contributor entry point is [`docs/dogfooding.md`](../../../../docs/dogfooding.md);
read that for the workflow steps. The mechanics that make the system
load-bearing for design integrity:

- **Chain structure.** A *chain* groups related handoffs that test one aspect
  of the system. Each handoff is one experiment dispatched against the
  `playground/` workspace (which contains intentional defects). Chains live at
  `docs/superpowers/dogfood/<chain-slug>/` and are gitignored — they are
  ephemeral working state.
- **Handoff format.** Each handoff is a markdown file with frontmatter
  carrying `prev_handoff`, `status`, and `what_were_testing` fields. The
  `# Task for the TDD orchestrator` section is what gets dispatched verbatim
  to the orchestrator. The `# What the orchestrator MUST NOT know` section is
  for the main agent's verification. The two are kept rigorously separate by
  the iron law: the orchestrator receives only the task section, never the
  frontmatter, never the meta-goal.
- **Cheatsheet.** `.claude/playground-cheatsheet.md` is the answer key for the
  intentional defects in `playground/`. The main agent reads it to verify
  orchestrator output. It is invisible to the orchestrator — referencing it
  in a dispatch prompt would invalidate the experiment. New playground
  defects must be documented in the cheatsheet.
- **Seven-step verification protocol.** After the orchestrator returns, the
  main agent runs a fixed seven-step audit against the database state, the
  channel events received, the artifacts written, and the test/code changes.
  The protocol lives in `.claude/skills/dogfood/SKILL.md` and is what makes
  dogfood actionable — without it, "the test passes" is the least
  interesting signal.

The dogfood system was the primary development driver for hook and agent
behaviors in this directory. Round-1 dogfood runs surfaced the defects that
motivated D11 (evidence binding gaps), D12 (three-tier hierarchy), and D13
(capability-vs-scoping). Findings from past runs are at
`docs/superpowers/dogfood/<chain-slug>/findings.md` while a chain is open;
once absorbed and any system fixes have landed, the chain folder is deleted.

**Reboot-table sync requirement.** The skill at `.claude/skills/dogfood/SKILL.md`
carries the canonical reboot table — what action is required when a given file
type changes (none / `/reload-plugins` / full Claude Code restart).
`docs/dogfooding.md` carries an abridged version of the same table for human
contributors. The two must agree. When either is updated, both must be
updated. The canonical version lives in the skill; the docs version is the
abridged sibling. This is a manual sync — there is no script — and it is the
single most likely place for the dogfood system to drift.

## Rationale

**Why a file-based plugin and not a published npm package.** Plugins are how
Claude Code learns about agent-specific MCP servers, hooks, skills, and
commands. The npm packages can ship without the plugin (a user can install
`vitest-agent-plugin` and use it as a vanilla Vitest reporter); the plugin
adds the AI integration on top. Distributing through the Claude marketplace
keeps the plugin surface independent of the npm release cadence. See D20.

**Why hooks in shell, not Node.** Hooks fire dozens of times per session and
must start fast. A Node-based hook pays a 100–200ms startup cost per
invocation; a POSIX shell hook is essentially instant. The shell scripts use
`jq` for JSON parsing and shell out to `vitest-agent` for any database
writes — the heavy lifting is in the CLI binary, not the hook itself.

**Why the orchestrator is one agent, not several.** A red-only agent, a
green-only agent, and a refactor-only agent would each need their own context
fork and their own MCP gate setup. Combining the cycle into one agent
preserves continuity within a behavior cycle and keeps the iron law (no
production code without a failing test first) enforceable in one place — the
agent's prompt and the hook layer that gates its tools. Per-phase
sub-orchestrators would multiply the number of `subagent-start` and
`subagent-stop` hooks for marginal isolation gain.

**Why the loader uses the user's package manager.** The MCP server is its own
npm package with its own bin entry. The user's PM already knows how to
resolve and execute project bins (hoisting rules, monorepo awareness, PnP
support). Re-implementing that resolution in the loader was the wrong layer
of abstraction. A missing peer dep now surfaces as a PM-level error with
PM-native install instructions, not a cryptic dynamic-import failure.
See D30.
