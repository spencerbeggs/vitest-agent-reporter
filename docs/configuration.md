# Configuration

## AgentPlugin Options

`AgentPlugin` is the recommended entry point. It wraps `AgentReporter` and
handles environment detection, reporter injection, and cache directory
resolution automatically.

```typescript
import { AgentPlugin } from "vitest-agent-reporter";
import { defineConfig } from "vitest/config";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    AgentPlugin({
      mode: "auto",
      reporter: {
        coverageThresholds: { lines: 80, branches: 80 },
        coverageTargets: { lines: 95, branches: 90 },
        coverageConsoleLimit: 5,
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

### `mode`

| Value | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `"auto"` (default) | Detect environment from env vars -- agent, CI, or human |
| `"agent"` | Force agent mode: suppress built-in reporters, show markdown |
| `"silent"` | Force silent mode: database only, no console output |

When `mode` is `"auto"`, the plugin checks environment variables to determine
the runtime context. See [Agent Detection](#agent-detection) for the full
list.

### `strategy`

| Value | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `"complement"` (default) | Layer on top of Vitest's built-in reporters; does not strip console reporters |
| `"own"` | Strip built-in console reporters and take over console output entirely |

Controls how `AgentPlugin` interacts with existing reporters in the chain.
`"complement"` is additive -- it keeps Vitest's built-in reporters and adds
database persistence. `"own"` removes console reporters and uses the agent
formatter exclusively (Phase 1 behavior).

This option was previously named `consoleStrategy`. The old name is still
accepted for backward compatibility and mapped internally.

### `format`

| Value | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `"markdown"` | Structured markdown output (default for agents) |
| `"json"` | JSON output |
| `"vitest-bypass"` | Let Vitest's built-in reporters handle console output |
| `"silent"` | No console output |

When not set, the format is automatically selected based on the detected
environment and executor.

### `logLevel`

Log level for Effect runtime logging. Accepts `"debug"`, `"info"`,
`"warn"`, `"error"`, or `"none"`. Case-insensitive. When set to `"debug"`,
the reporter emits detailed logs for each lifecycle hook and Effect service
call. Defaults to `"info"`.

### `logFile`

Path to a log file. When set, Effect runtime log output is written to this
file instead of stderr. Useful for capturing debug output without polluting
the terminal.

### `mcp`

When `true`, the "Next steps" section of console output includes a hint
to use MCP tools (`test_history`, `test_coverage`, `test_trends`) for
deeper analysis. Defaults to `false`. Set automatically when the Claude
Code plugin is active.

### `reporter`

Nested reporter options passed through to `AgentReporter`. The plugin manages
console output and GitHub Actions detection automatically based on environment
detection, so those fields are not available through the plugin interface.

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `cacheDir` | `string` | XDG-derived (see [Cache Directory Resolution](#cache-directory-resolution)) | Override the cache directory path |
| `coverageThresholds` | `object` | `{}` | Vitest-native threshold format (per-metric, per-glob) |
| `coverageTargets` | `object` | -- | Aspirational coverage targets (same format as thresholds) |
| `autoUpdate` | `boolean` | `true` when targets set | Auto-ratchet baselines when coverage improves |
| `coverageConsoleLimit` | `number` | `10` | Max low-coverage files shown in console |
| `omitPassingTests` | `boolean` | `true` | Exclude passing tests from reports |
| `includeBareZero` | `boolean` | `false` | Include files where all four metrics are 0% |
| `githubSummaryFile` | `string` | `GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` env var | Override the GFM output file path |

## AgentReporter Options

When using `AgentReporter` directly (without the plugin), all options are
available:

```typescript
import { AgentReporter } from "vitest-agent-reporter";
import { defineConfig } from "vitest/config";

export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    reporters: [
      new AgentReporter({
        cacheDir: ".vitest-agent-reporter",
        consoleOutput: "failures",
        omitPassingTests: true,
        coverageThresholds: { lines: 80, branches: 80 },
        coverageConsoleLimit: 10,
        includeBareZero: false,
        format: "markdown",
        detail: "standard",
        githubActions: false,
        githubSummaryFile: undefined,
      }),
    ],
  },
});
```

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `cacheDir` | `string` | XDG-derived (see [Cache Directory Resolution](#cache-directory-resolution)) | Directory for the SQLite database (`data.db`) |
| `consoleOutput` | `"failures"` `"full"` `"silent"` | `"failures"` | Console output verbosity |
| `omitPassingTests` | `boolean` | `true` | Exclude passing tests from reports |
| `coverageThresholds` | `object` | `{}` | Vitest-native threshold format (see below) |
| `coverageTargets` | `object` | -- | Aspirational coverage targets (same format) |
| `autoUpdate` | `boolean` | `true` when targets set | Auto-ratchet baselines when coverage improves |
| `coverageConsoleLimit` | `number` | `10` | Max low-coverage files shown in console |
| `includeBareZero` | `boolean` | `false` | Include files where all four metrics are 0% |
| `format` | `OutputFormat` | auto-detect | Output format: `"markdown"`, `"json"`, `"vitest-bypass"`, `"silent"` |
| `detail` | `DetailLevel` | auto-detect | Detail level: `"minimal"`, `"neutral"`, `"standard"`, `"verbose"` |
| `githubActions` | `boolean` | auto-detect | Force GFM output on/off |
| `githubSummaryFile` | `string` | `GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` env var | Override the GFM output file path |
| `logLevel` | `string` | `"info"` | Effect log level: `"debug"`, `"info"`, `"warn"`, `"error"`, `"none"` |
| `logFile` | `string` | -- | Path to write log output (defaults to stderr) |
| `mcp` | `boolean` | `false` | Show MCP tool hints in "Next steps" output |
| `projectFilter` | `string` | -- | Glob pattern to filter which projects are included in output |

### `format` (OutputFormat)

Controls the output format for console output:

| Value | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `"markdown"` | Structured markdown (default for agent environments) |
| `"json"` | JSON output |
| `"vitest-bypass"` | Defer to Vitest's built-in reporters |
| `"silent"` | No console output |

### `detail` (DetailLevel)

Controls the verbosity of console output:

| Value | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `"minimal"` | One-line summary (used for green-tier all-pass runs) |
| `"neutral"` | Summary with coverage hints (used for yellow-tier below-target runs) |
| `"standard"` | Full detail with errors and diffs (used for red-tier failures) |
| `"verbose"` | Maximum detail including passing tests |

When not set, the detail level is resolved automatically based on the
executor (agent, human, CI) and run health (all pass, below targets,
failures).

## Cache Directory Resolution

In 2.0 the SQLite database lives at an XDG-derived path keyed off the
root workspace's `package.json` `name`. The default location is:

```text
$XDG_DATA_HOME/vitest-agent-reporter/<workspaceName>/data.db
# falling back to
~/.local/share/vitest-agent-reporter/<workspaceName>/data.db
```

`<workspaceName>` is the `name` field from your root workspace's
`package.json`, normalized for filesystem safety (so `@org/pkg` becomes
`@org__pkg`). Two checkouts of the same repo therefore share history,
and the database survives `rm -rf node_modules`.

Resolution priority (highest to lowest):

1. **Explicit option** -- `reporter.cacheDir` (plugin) or `cacheDir`
   (direct reporter). Used as a literal path; the resolver short-circuits.
2. **`vitest-agent-reporter.config.toml` at the workspace root** --
   either `cacheDir = "./.vitest-agent-reporter"` (override the entire
   directory) or `projectKey = "my-app-personal"` (override just the
   `<workspaceName>` slot).
3. **XDG default** -- `$XDG_DATA_HOME/vitest-agent-reporter/<workspaceName>/`.

The workspace root is located by walking up from the project directory
looking for a `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, a `workspaces` field in
`package.json`, or a `.git` directory.

To opt back into the 1.x project-local layout, drop a
`vitest-agent-reporter.config.toml` next to your root `package.json`:

```toml
cacheDir = "./.vitest-agent-reporter"
```

## Coverage Thresholds

The `coverageThresholds` option uses Vitest's native threshold format. Files
with any metric below their applicable threshold appear in the "Coverage gaps"
section of console output and reports.

```typescript
AgentPlugin({
  reporter: {
    // Per-metric thresholds
    coverageThresholds: {
      lines: 80,
      branches: 75,
      functions: 80,
      statements: 80,
    },
  },
});
```

When using `AgentPlugin`, thresholds are resolved in this order:

1. **Explicit option** -- `reporter.coverageThresholds` in plugin options
2. **Vitest config** -- `coverage.thresholds` from your Vitest config
3. **Default** -- `{}` (no files flagged)

Per-glob patterns are also supported:

```typescript
coverageThresholds: {
  lines: 80,
  "src/utils/**": { lines: 90 },
  "src/generated/**": { lines: 0 },
}
```

Negative numbers specify maximum uncovered items (matching Vitest's format),
and `100` enforces full coverage. The `perFile` boolean applies thresholds
per file rather than in aggregate.

**Bare-zero files** (all four metrics at 0%) are excluded by default. These
are typically generated files, re-exports, or index files with no executable
code. Set `includeBareZero: true` to include them.

## Coverage Targets

Targets represent aspirational coverage goals. Unlike thresholds, falling
below a target does not produce a "red" failure -- it produces a "yellow"
hint showing room for improvement.

```typescript
AgentPlugin({
  reporter: {
    coverageThresholds: { lines: 70 },   // hard floor
    coverageTargets: { lines: 90 },      // aspirational goal
  },
});
```

The format is identical to `coverageThresholds` -- per-metric values and
per-glob patterns are supported.

### Auto-Ratcheting Baselines

When `coverageTargets` is set, the reporter automatically tracks a
high-water mark (baseline) for each metric. When coverage improves, the
baseline ratchets up so it never regresses. Baselines are stored in the
SQLite database.

Set `autoUpdate: false` to disable auto-ratcheting:

```typescript
AgentPlugin({
  reporter: {
    coverageTargets: { lines: 90 },
    autoUpdate: false,
  },
});
```

## Coverage Trends

The reporter records a coverage trend entry on each full test run. Trends
are stored per project in the SQLite database with a 50-entry sliding
window.

Console output uses a three-tier system based on coverage state:

| Tier | Condition | Console behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Green | All tests pass, all targets met | Single success line with trend direction |
| Yellow | All tests pass, some files below targets | "Room for improvement" section with target gaps |
| Red | Test failures or files below thresholds | Standard failure output with coverage gaps |

Use the CLI `trends` command for detailed trend analysis:

```bash
npx vitest-agent-reporter trends
```

## Console Output Modes

The `consoleOutput` option controls what the reporter prints to stdout.

### `"failures"` (default)

Shows only failed tests with error messages, diffs, and re-run commands.
Coverage gaps are shown if any files are below threshold. When all tests
pass, a single success line is printed.

### `"full"`

Same as `"failures"` but also includes passing test counts and full module
listings.

### `"silent"`

No console output. Data is still written to the SQLite database. GFM
output is still produced when in GitHub Actions.

This is the mode used automatically when the plugin detects a human
developer or CI environment.

## Environment Detection Override

The `mode` option on `AgentPlugin` overrides automatic detection:

```typescript
// Always act as if an agent is running
AgentPlugin({ mode: "agent" })

// Always suppress console output
AgentPlugin({ mode: "silent" })
```

This is useful for:

- **Testing the reporter** -- force agent mode to see markdown output
- **CI pipelines** -- force silent mode when you only want database persistence
- **Custom tooling** -- agents not yet in the detection list

## Agent Detection

When `mode` is `"auto"`, the plugin uses
[std-env](https://github.com/nicolo-ribaudo/std-env) for agent detection.
The following environment variables are checked (list maintained by
`std-env` and may expand as new agents are added):

| Variable | Value | Agent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AI_AGENT` | any truthy | Cross-tool standard |
| `AUGMENT_AGENT` | `"1"` | Augment Code |
| `CLAUDECODE` | `"1"` | Claude Code |
| `CLINE_ACTIVE` | `"true"` | Cline (VS Code extension) |
| `CODEX_SANDBOX` | any value | OpenAI Codex CLI |
| `CURSOR_TRACE_ID` | any value | Cursor IDE |
| `CURSOR_AGENT` | `"1"` | Cursor CLI agent |
| `GEMINI_CLI` | `"1"` | Gemini CLI / Gemini Code Assist |
| `AGENT` | any truthy | Goose, Amp, generic agents |

If no agent variables match, CI detection runs:

| Variable | Value | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GITHUB_ACTIONS` | `"true"` or `"1"` | CI mode |
| `CI` | `"true"` | CI mode |

If nothing matches, the environment is classified as `"human"`.
