# MCP Server

The `vitest-agent-reporter-mcp` binary provides an
[MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server over stdio transport,
exposing 24 tools for querying test data, managing notes, running
tests, and discovering project structure. LLM agent hosts like Claude
Code can call these tools directly during a session.

## How It Works

After each test run, `AgentReporter` writes structured data to a SQLite
database. The MCP server reads this database on demand -- no background
process, no polling. Each tool call opens the database, executes a query,
and returns the result.

The server uses the `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` package and communicates
over stdio (stdin/stdout JSON-RPC).

## Starting the Server

### Automatic (via Claude Code plugin)

The Claude Code plugin registers the MCP server automatically. No manual
configuration needed:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add spencerbeggs/bot
/plugin install vitest-agent-reporter@spencerbeggs-bot --scope project
```

The plugin declares the MCP server inline in
`.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and ships a small loader at
`bin/mcp-server.mjs` that resolves and launches the server from
`vitest-agent-reporter` installed in your project's `node_modules`.
This means the package **must be installed as a project dependency**
for the plugin's MCP server to start; the loader fails fast with
explicit install instructions if it's missing.

### Manual

The MCP server lives in its own package (`vitest-agent-reporter-mcp`),
which auto-installs as a peer dependency of `vitest-agent-reporter` on
modern pnpm and npm. Start the server directly:

```bash
npx vitest-agent-reporter-mcp
```

Or add it to your `.mcp.json` manually:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vitest-reporter": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["vitest-agent-reporter-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

The server reads the SQLite database from the same XDG-derived path the
reporter writes to (default
`$XDG_DATA_HOME/vitest-agent-reporter/<workspaceName>/data.db`,
fallback `~/.local/share/vitest-agent-reporter/<workspaceName>/data.db`),
so a single test run populates data for the MCP tools, the CLI, and the
reporter's own console output.

## Notes System

Notes persist debugging findings, test observations, and planning context
across sessions. They are stored in the same SQLite database as test data.

### Scopes

| Scope | Use Case |
| --- | --- |
| `global` | Project-wide observations |
| `project` | Scoped to a Vitest project |
| `module` | Scoped to a test file |
| `suite` | Scoped to a test suite |
| `test` | Scoped to an individual test |
| `note` | Reply to another note (threaded) |

### Best Practices

- Use `note_create` to record debugging findings for future sessions
- Use `note_search` to check for existing context before investigating
  a test failure
- Use `pinned: true` for important notes that should not be missed
- Use `expiresAt` for temporary notes (e.g., "skip this test until fix
  is deployed")
- Use the `note` scope with `parentNoteId` for threaded discussions on
  a finding

### Example Workflow

```text
Agent: "test_history" shows test X is flaky

Agent: "note_search" for test X -- finds note from previous session:
  "Flaky due to race condition in async setup. Wrapping in retry
   workaround until #123 is merged."

Agent: Skips investigation, focuses on other failures
```
