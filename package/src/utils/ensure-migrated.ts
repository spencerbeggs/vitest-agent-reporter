/**
 * Process-level migration coordination.
 *
 * In multi-project Vitest configurations, a single Vitest process creates
 * multiple AgentReporter instances (one per project) that all share the
 * same SQLite database file. When run with a fresh database, each reporter
 * tries to apply migrations through its own SqliteClient connection. Two
 * connections both starting deferred transactions and then upgrading to
 * write produces SQLITE_BUSY (database is locked), and the SQLite busy
 * handler is not invoked for write-write upgrade conflicts in deferred
 * transactions.
 *
 * The fix is to serialize migration in the parent process: ensure the
 * database is migrated exactly once per dbPath before any reporter tries
 * to read or write. After migration completes, concurrent reads and
 * writes from separate connections work normally under WAL mode plus
 * better-sqlite3's 5s busy_timeout.
 *
 * The promise cache lives on `globalThis` because Vite's multi-project
 * pipeline can load this module under separate module instances even in
 * the same process; using a module-local Map results in independent
 * caches per project, which defeats the coordination.
 *
