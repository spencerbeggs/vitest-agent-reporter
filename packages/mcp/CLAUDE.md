# vitest-agent-mcp

The Model Context Protocol server (`vitest-agent-mcp` bin)
exposing 50 tools to LLM agents over stdio via `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`.
Routes tool calls through a tRPC router; runs as a long-lived process with
a `ManagedRuntime`. Also surfaces four MCP resources under two URI schemes
(vendored Vitest docs + curated patterns; per-page titles and
descriptions come from `manifest.json`, which the registrar's `list`
callback decodes via an Effect Schema) and six framing-only prompts
registered directly with the MCP SDK alongside the tRPC tool router.
Required as a peerDependency by the plugin package.

## Key files

| File | Purpose |
| ---- | ------- |
| `bin.ts` | `resolveProjectDir()` precedence: `VITEST_AGENT_REPORTER_PROJECT_DIR` -> `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` -> `process.cwd()`. Resolves `dbPath` via `resolveDataPath(projectDir)` then constructs the `ManagedRuntime` |
| `context.ts` | tRPC `McpContext` carrying the `ManagedRuntime` so procedures call `ctx.runtime.runPromise(effect)` |
| `router.ts` | Aggregates all 50 tool procedures; testable via `createCallerFactory(appRouter)` without starting the MCP server |
| `tools/run-tests.ts` | `spawnSync("vitest run", ...)` with configurable timeout (default 120s) |
| `tools/notes.ts` | All 6 note CRUD tools (`note_create`/`list`/`get`/`update`/`delete`/`search`) |
| `tools/tdd-session-get.ts` | Returns a markdown digest of a TDD session: phases, artifacts, and (when present) a `## Goals and Behaviors` section rendering each goal with its nested behavior statuses |
| `tools/tdd-{goal,behavior}-*.ts` | 10 new CRUD tools (2.0) for the Objective→Goal→Behavior hierarchy. `tdd_goal_create` is idempotent on `(sessionId, goal)`; `tdd_behavior_create` is idempotent on `(goalId, behavior)`. The two `*_delete` tools are denied to the orchestrator at the plugin's `pre-tool-use-tdd-restricted.sh` hook and intentionally omitted from `safe-mcp-vitest-agent-ops.txt` so main-agent calls fall through to the standard permission prompt |
| `tools/_tdd-error-envelope.ts` | Private 2.0 helper that catches the five tagged TDD errors (`GoalNotFoundError`, `BehaviorNotFoundError`, `TddSessionNotFoundError`, `TddSessionAlreadyEndedError`, `IllegalStatusTransitionError`) and surfaces them as success-shape `{ ok: false, error: { _tag, ..., remediation } }` responses |
| `tools/tdd-phase-transition-request.ts` | 2.0: `goalId` is now required; the tool pre-checks goal status and behavior membership before running the D2 binding-rule validator. On accept with a `behaviorId`, auto-promotes the behavior `pending → in_progress` in the same SQL transaction as `writeTddPhase`. The validator also rejects `spike→green` and `refactor→green` with `wrong_source_phase` — the red phase must be entered explicitly first |

## Conventions

- **`ManagedRuntime`, not per-call `Effect.runPromise`.** The MCP
  server is long-lived; per-call layer construction would re-open
  SQLite on every tool invocation. tRPC procedures call
  `ctx.runtime.runPromise(effect)` against the shared runtime.
- **Three external runtime deps unique here:**
  `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, `@trpc/server`, `zod`. zod is for
  tRPC tool input schemas only -- domain data structures still use
  Effect Schema (from `-shared`). Don't conflate the two.
- **Tool output conventions:**
  - Meta + read-only + discovery tools: return markdown via
    `OutputRenderer`.
  - `run_tests`: returns text (raw vitest output).
  - Notes: list/search return markdown; create/get/update/delete
    return JSON.
- **50 tools, 1 router.** New tools register in `server.ts` AND
  `router.ts`. The Claude Code plugin's allowlist
  (`plugin/hooks/lib/safe-mcp-vitest-agent-ops.txt`) must
  also be updated for auto-allow to work without a permission prompt.
  Destructive tools (`tdd_goal_delete`, `tdd_behavior_delete`) are
  intentionally omitted from the allowlist so they prompt for user
  confirmation; the orchestrator subagent is also blocked from
  calling them at the runtime hook layer
  (`pre-tool-use-tdd-restricted.sh`).
- **Resources and prompts use the SDK's native APIs, not tRPC.**
  tRPC owns the tool surface; resources go through
  `server.registerResource` (with `ResourceTemplate` + `{ list:
  undefined }` for the page templates so the SDK doesn't enumerate
  every page on `resources/list` — the index URIs serve that role)
  and prompts go through `server.registerPrompt`. Both surfaces
  share the same `McpServer` instance, the same stdio transport,
  and the same process. Don't try to bridge resources/prompts
  through the tRPC router.
- **Two URI schemes for resources.** `vitest://` is vendored
  upstream content (provenance: vitest-dev/vitest at a pinned tag,
  MIT-licensed via `ATTRIBUTION.md`); `vitest-agent://` is content
  authored for this project. Splitting the schemes is load-bearing
  for licensing/provenance clarity — don't conflate them.
- **Prompts are framing-only.** Each prompt's factory returns
  templated user messages that orient the agent toward the right
  tools. The factories MUST NOT call into `DataReader` /
  `DataStore` to pre-fetch tool data on the server — selection
  cost is zero tool roundtrips by design, and the agent fetches
  data via tools after the prompt orients it.
- **Vendor snapshot is checked in.** The `src/vendor/vitest-docs/`
  tree ships in git. Don't fetch on demand at runtime — the MCP
  server often runs without network egress. The snapshot is
  refreshed through an explicit human action (the project-local
  `.claude/skills/update-vitest-snapshot/` skill + the
  `lib/scripts/` TS pipeline), not silently between server starts.
  Living under `src/` is load-bearing for turbo cache invalidation:
  refreshes correctly show up as build-affecting.
- **`fetch-upstream-docs.ts` uses `execFileSync` only.** The
  fetcher takes a tag argument and passes it to `git`. Building a
  shell command with `execSync` and string interpolation opens a
  shell-injection hole; the array-args form treats the tag verbatim
  as one argv element. The new TS script preserves this invariant
  inherited from the 1.x `update-vitest-snapshot.mjs`. Don't regress
  this when editing the script.
- **`run_tests` uses `spawnSync` deliberately.** The MCP server
  cannot process other tool requests during a test run; this is
  acceptable because agents wait for results before proceeding.
  See Decision 21.

## When working in this package

- `projectDir` resolution: the plugin loader sets
  `VITEST_AGENT_REPORTER_PROJECT_DIR` because Claude Code does not
  reliably propagate `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` to MCP subprocesses. Don't
  drop the env var fallback.
- Adding a tool: define a tRPC procedure in `tools/<name>.ts`, add
  to `router.ts`, register the SDK handler in `server.ts`, update
  `tools/help.ts`'s tool list, and add the suffix to the plugin's
  `safe-mcp-vitest-agent-ops.txt` allowlist (omit destructive tools
  intentionally so they prompt; consider whether the new tool also
  needs a denial in `pre-tool-use-tdd-restricted.sh` if it should
  not be callable by the TDD orchestrator). For tools surfacing the
  five TDD tagged errors, use the `_tdd-error-envelope.ts` helper
  to wrap the catch.
- Testing tools: use `createCallerFactory(appRouter)` with a mock
  context. See `router.test.ts` and `tools/run-tests.test.ts` for
  the pattern -- don't start the MCP server in tests.
- Tool input validation uses zod (tRPC requirement). Keep zod
  schemas minimal -- they're just for argument shape, not domain
  validation. Domain validation happens in the underlying
  `DataReader`/`DataStore` calls.
- `DataReader` discovery tools (`project_list`, `module_list`,
  `suite_list`, `test_list`) enumerate every project from
  `getRunsByProject()` when `project` is unspecified. Don't default
  to a literal `"default"` (post-2.0 bug fix).
- The MCP server's runtime is constructed once at startup. If
  `dbPath` resolution fails at boot, the server should not start --
  surface the error via stderr and exit non-zero so the loader can
  print install instructions.
- Adding a resource: drop the markdown into `src/vendor/vitest-docs/`
  (vendored upstream — the snapshot pipeline at `lib/scripts/`
  manages this) or `src/patterns/` (curated content — author
  directly + update `_meta.json`). For `src/vendor/vitest-docs/`,
  every page MUST have a corresponding entry in `manifest.json`'s
  `pages[]` array (path, title, description) — the registrar's
  `list` callback in `resources/index.ts` reads it to emit the
  per-page resource list MCP clients see in their picker. The
  existing template URIs (`vitest://docs/{+path}`,
  `vitest-agent://patterns/{slug}`) automatically address the file
  itself; no registrar change unless adding a new URI scheme. If
  adding a new scheme, register it in `resources/index.ts`, add a
  reader file using path-traversal-safe root resolution, and extend
  `copyPatterns` in `rslib.config.ts` for the new content tree.
- Adding a prompt: create `prompts/<slug>.ts` exporting a factory
  that returns one or more user-role messages. Add a zod arg schema
  and register the prompt in `prompts/index.ts`. Keep the factory
  pure — no `DataReader` / `DataStore` calls. If the prompt has a
  closed enum argument, mirror the pattern in `wrapup.ts` where the
  `WrapupKind` union is re-exported and the registrar coerces
  `args.kind` through it.
- Refreshing the vendored Vitest docs: invoke the project-local
  `.claude/skills/update-vitest-snapshot/SKILL.md` skill (the
  recommended path — it walks the agent through five phases:
  fetch → prune → scaffold → enrich → validate, with explicit user
  checkpoints; the agent's careful per-page description authoring
  during the enrich phase is the "load when" signal that drives MCP
  resource discoverability). Or run the scripts manually in order:
  `pnpm exec tsx packages/mcp/lib/scripts/fetch-upstream-docs.ts
  --tag <vN.M.K>`, then `build-snapshot.ts`, then
  `validate-snapshot.ts`. The pipeline rewrites
  `src/vendor/vitest-docs/` and `manifest.json` (`tag`, `commitSha`,
  `capturedAt`, plus `pages[]` metadata after enrichment). Commit
  the whole `src/vendor/vitest-docs/` tree as a single change. The
  npm script alias for `update-vitest-snapshot` was removed in
  favor of the explicit `tsx` invocations.
- Adding to the build pipeline: vendor and patterns are mirrored
  into `dist/<env>/` by rslib's `copyPatterns` declaration in
  `rslib.config.ts` (`[{ from: "src/vendor", to: "vendor" }, { from:
  "src/patterns", to: "patterns" }]`). The 1.x postbuild copier
  (`scripts/copy-vendor-to-dist.mjs`, chained via `&&` from
  `build:dev` / `build:prod`) is gone. Build outputs are unchanged
  at the dist level: `dist/<env>/vendor/` and `dist/<env>/patterns/`
  remain siblings of the compiled `resources/` directory, so the
  runtime path resolution in `resources/index.ts` still works
  post-build.
- Adding a new content tree (e.g., `vitest-agent://decisions/`):
  add the source directory under `src/` as a sibling of
  `src/vendor/` and `src/patterns/`, extend `copyPatterns` in
  `rslib.config.ts` with another `{ from, to }` entry to mirror it
  into `dist/<env>/`, and resolve the new root from
  `import.meta.url` in `resources/index.ts` using the same
  dev/post-build dual-path pattern.
