/**
 * vitest-agent-mcp
 *
 * Model Context Protocol server for vitest-agent. Exposes 24 tools
 * via tRPC over stdio that give agents structured access to test data,
 * coverage, history, trends, errors, and notes — backed by the SQLite
 * database that the reporter writes during test runs.
 *
 * The default entry point is `bin.ts` (registered as the
 * `vitest-agent-mcp` bin); this barrel re-exports the supporting
 * pieces for programmatic use.
