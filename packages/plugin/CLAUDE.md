# vitest-agent-plugin

The Vitest plugin (`agentPlugin()`) and internal `AgentReporter` Vitest-API
class. Owns the Vitest lifecycle hooks, persistence, classification,
baseline/trend computation, and delegates rendering to a user-supplied
`VitestAgentReporterFactory`. Declares `vitest-agent-reporter`,
`vitest-agent-cli`, and `vitest-agent-mcp` as required peerDependencies.

## Key files

| File | Purpose |
| ---- | ------- |
| `plugin.ts` | `agentPlugin(options?)` factory. Resolves env + cacheDir + coverage options; suppresses Vitest's coverage table in agent/own mode; injects `AgentReporter` per project via `configureVitest` |
| `reporter.ts` | Internal `AgentReporter` class. `onInit` resolves `dbPath` async; `onTestRunEnd` runs the full persistence/classification/baseline/trend pipeline, then calls `opts.reporter(kit)` and routes `RenderedOutput[]` |
| `services/CoverageAnalyzer.ts` | Effect service tag for coverage processing. Only lives here because the reporter lifecycle class feeds it coverage data; CLI/MCP read pre-processed coverage from SQLite |
| `utils/process-failure.ts` | Per-error signature pipeline. Called from `onTestRunEnd` for each error before `DataStore.writeErrors`. Returns `frames: StackFrameInput[]` and `signatureHash` |
| `utils/build-reporter-kit.ts` | Constructs `ReporterKit` from resolved config + detected environment + `noColor` flag. `stdOsc8` is enabled when `!noColor && (env === "terminal" \|\| env === "agent-shell")` |
| `utils/route-rendered-output.ts` | Dispatches a single `RenderedOutput` to its target: `stdout`, `github-summary` (append), or `file` (no-op) |
| `layers/ReporterLive.ts` | Composition layer for `AgentReporter`. Used per-run via `Effect.runPromise` (not ManagedRuntime — the reporter is short-lived per run) |

## Conventions

- **No standalone `AgentReporter` export.** The class is an internal
  implementation detail constructed by `agentPlugin()`. Don't export it.
  Users who want custom rendering implement `VitestAgentReporterFactory`
  and pass it as `reporterFactory` to `agentPlugin()`.
- **Per-call layer construction is fine here.** The reporter runs
  `Effect.runPromise` in `onTestRunEnd` with `ReporterLive(dbPath)` inline.
  This is appropriate because the reporter runs briefly per test suite.
  Only the MCP server uses `ManagedRuntime`.
- **`ensureMigrated` must be awaited before the main Effect.** In
  multi-project configs, multiple reporter instances share one `data.db`;
  `ensureMigrated` serializes the migration step via the `globalThis`
  promise cache (Decision 28). On rejection, print `formatFatalError` and
  return early.
- **`process-failure.ts` is the only place signatures are computed.**
  Don't compute failure signatures directly in `reporter.ts`. The pipeline:
  `processFailure(error, options)` -> `{ frames, signatureHash }` ->
  `DataStore.writeFailureSignature` -> `DataStore.writeErrors` (with the
  `signatureHash` and `frames` on `TestErrorInput`).
- **`configure Vitest` is async.** Vitest awaits plugin hooks; the
  plugin calls `Effect.runPromise` for environment detection there.
  Don't make it synchronous.
- **Per-project reporter instances.** The plugin passes
  `projectFilter: project.name` to `AgentReporter` so each instance
  filters `testModules` to its own project. Coverage dedup: only the
  first alphabetical project processes the global `CoverageMap`.

## When working in this package

- Adding a new reporter option: extend `AgentPluginOptions` (and
  `AgentReporterOptions`) in `vitest-agent-sdk`'s `schemas/Options.ts`,
  then thread it through `plugin.ts` -> `reporter.ts` ->
  `build-reporter-kit.ts` -> `ResolvedReporterConfig` as needed.
- Adding a new utility that only this package uses: put it in
  `utils/`. If the utility is needed by MCP or CLI too, it belongs
  in `vitest-agent-sdk/utils/` or `vitest-agent-sdk/lib/`.
- Changing coverage behavior: `CoverageAnalyzer` lives in this package.
  CLI and MCP read pre-processed coverage from SQLite via `DataReader`;
  they never call `CoverageAnalyzer` directly.
- Changing reporter output routing: edit `route-rendered-output.ts`.
  The three targets are: `stdout` (write to `process.stdout`),
  `github-summary` (append to the configured summary file), `file`
  (reserved no-op).
- `strip-console-reporters.ts` removes `default`, `verbose`, `tree`,
  `dot`, `tap`, `tap-flat`, `hanging-process`, `agent` reporters in
  own mode. Custom reporters (class instances, file paths) and
  non-console built-ins (`json`, `junit`, `html`, `blob`,
  `github-actions`) are preserved.

  Load when working on `AgentPlugin`, the internal `AgentReporter`,
  `CoverageAnalyzer`, or the reporter-side utilities.
- `.claude/design/vitest-agent/data-flows.md`
  Load when tracing the test-run pipeline (Flow 1: end-to-end run
  persistence; Flow 2: coverage processing and dedup).
- `.claude/design/vitest-agent/decisions.md`
  Load when you need rationale (especially D34 plugin/reporter split,
  D7 per-call `Effect.runPromise`, D28 `ensureMigrated` globalThis
  cache, D10 failure signatures).
