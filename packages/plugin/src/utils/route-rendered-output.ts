/**
 * Route a {@link RenderedOutput} entry to its declared target.
 *
 * Centralizes the side-effects that user-supplied reporters get to stay
 * pure about: writing to stdout, appending to a github-summary file, or
 * writing to an arbitrary file path. The plugin's internal Vitest reporter
 * calls this once per `RenderedOutput` returned by the user's reporter(s).
 *
 * `github-summary` writes go to `kit.config.githubSummaryFile` if set,
 * otherwise `process.env.GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`. When neither is set the
 * write is silently dropped — the typical case is "we're not under
 * GitHub Actions and the user-supplied reporter shouldn't have produced
 * one anyway."
 *
 * `file` outputs require an explicit path embedded in the output (a
 * convention reporters should adopt; this helper currently treats `file`
 * as a no-op until we settle on a path field). The default reporter
 * never produces `file` outputs today, so this gap is theoretical.
