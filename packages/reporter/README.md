A Vitest reporter that gives LLM coding agents superpowers -- persistent
test intelligence, coverage analysis, failure history, and notes via MCP
tools.

## Features

- **SQLite persistence** -- normalized database replaces JSON files for
  richer queries and cross-run analysis
- **MCP server** -- 41 tools over stdio for deep integration with LLM
  agents (test data, notes, coverage, discovery, run tests)
- **Claude Code plugin** -- auto-registers MCP tools, injects test
  context at session start, and provides teaching skills
- **Zero-config agent detection** -- uses
  [std-env](https://github.com/nicolo-ribaudo/std-env) to detect Claude
  Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Codex, Devin, and other agents automatically
- **Coverage thresholds and targets** -- Vitest-native threshold format
  plus aspirational targets with auto-ratcheting baselines
- **Coverage trends** -- tracks coverage direction across runs with
  tiered console output (green/yellow/red)
- **Failure history** -- per-test pass/fail tracking with classification:
  `stable`, `new-failure`, `persistent`, `flaky`, `recovered`
- **Notes system** -- CRUD + full-text search for persisting debugging
  notes across sessions
- **GitHub Actions GFM** -- writes structured summaries to
  `GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` automatically in CI
- **CLI bin** -- query test status, coverage gaps, failure history, and
  trends from the command line

## Quick Start

Install the package:

```bash
npm install vitest-agent-reporter
```

Modern pnpm and npm auto-install the required peer dependencies
(`vitest-agent-reporter-cli` for the CLI bin and
`vitest-agent-reporter-mcp` for the MCP server bin). If your package
manager is configured to skip peers, install them explicitly:

```bash
pnpm add -D vitest-agent-reporter vitest-agent-reporter-cli vitest-agent-reporter-mcp
```

Add `AgentPlugin` to your Vitest config with coverage thresholds and
aspirational targets:

```typescript
import { AgentPlugin } from "vitest-agent-reporter";
import { defineConfig } from "vitest/config";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    AgentPlugin({
      reporter: {
        coverageThresholds: { lines: 80, branches: 80 },
        coverageTargets: { lines: 95, branches: 90 },
      },
    }),
  ],
  test: {
    coverage: {
      provider: "v8",
    },
  },
});
```

Install the Claude Code plugin for the full agent experience:

```bash
# Add the plugin marketplace (one-time setup)
/plugin marketplace add spencerbeggs/bot

# Install the plugin for this project
/plugin install vitest-agent-reporter@spencerbeggs-bot --scope project
```

That's it. The plugin detects whether an agent, CI, or human is running
tests and adjusts output automatically. Agents get 41 MCP tools for
querying test data, tracking coverage, and persisting notes -- with no
manual MCP configuration.

## What Agents See

When tests fail, the reporter produces actionable markdown output with
classification labels, coverage gaps, and next steps:

````markdown
## x Vitest -- 2 failed, 10 passed (520ms)

Coverage regressing over 3 runs

### x `src/utils.test.ts`

- x **compressLines > compresses consecutive lines** [new-failure]
  Expected "1-3,5" but received "1,2,3,5"

  ```diff
  - Expected
  + Received

  - "1-3,5"
  + "1,2,3,5"
  ```

- x **compressLines > handles duplicates** [persistent]
  Expected [1,2] to equal [1]

### Coverage gaps

- `src/coverage.ts` -- Lines: 42% (threshold: 80%) -- uncovered: 65-80,95-110
- `src/utils.ts` -- Lines: 72% (target: 95%) -- uncovered: 42-50,99

### Next steps

- 1 new failure since last run
- 1 persistent failure across 3 runs
- Re-run: `pnpm vitest run src/utils.test.ts`
- Run `pnpm vitest-agent-reporter coverage` for gap analysis
- Run `pnpm vitest-agent-reporter trends` for coverage trajectory
````

When all tests pass and targets are met, output collapses to a single
summary line.

## How It Works

The plugin detects three environments and adapts behavior:

| Environment | Detection | Console | Database | GFM Summary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Agent | `std-env` agent detection | Structured markdown | Yes | Auto |
| CI | `GITHUB_ACTIONS`, `CI=true` | Silent (existing reporters kept) | Yes | Yes |
| Human | No agent/CI vars detected | Silent (existing reporters kept) | Yes | No |

After each test run, `AgentReporter` writes structured data to a SQLite
database under your XDG data directory (default
`$XDG_DATA_HOME/vitest-agent-reporter/<workspaceName>/data.db`,
falling back to `~/.local/share/vitest-agent-reporter/<workspaceName>/data.db`).
The location is derived from your root `package.json` `name`, so two
worktrees of the same repo share history. Override the location via
`vitest-agent-reporter.config.toml` at the workspace root:

```toml
# Override the entire data directory
cacheDir = "./.vitest-agent-reporter"

# Or override just the workspace key
projectKey = "my-app-personal"
```

The MCP server and CLI both query this database on demand -- no
background process required.

## Claude Code Plugin

A companion [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)
plugin provides the full agent-native experience:

```bash
# Add the plugin marketplace (one-time setup)
/plugin marketplace add spencerbeggs/bot

# Install the plugin for this project
/plugin install vitest-agent-reporter@spencerbeggs-bot --scope project
```

The plugin provides:

- **MCP auto-registration** -- all 41 tools available immediately with
  no manual `.mcp.json` configuration
- **SessionStart hook** -- injects project status and available tools
  into Claude's context at the start of each session
- **PostToolUse hook** -- detects test runs and suggests MCP tools for
  deeper analysis when tests fail
- **Skills** -- `/vitest-agent-reporter:tdd`,
  `/vitest-agent-reporter:debugging`,
  `/vitest-agent-reporter:configuration`
- **Commands** -- `/vitest-agent-reporter:setup` (add plugin to vitest
  config), `/vitest-agent-reporter:configure` (view/modify settings)

## MCP Tools

The package includes an MCP server (`vitest-agent-reporter-mcp`) that
exposes test data as tools over stdio transport. The Claude Code plugin
registers this automatically, but you can also start it manually:

```bash
npx vitest-agent-reporter-mcp
```

## CLI

The `vitest-agent-reporter` CLI queries the SQLite database for on-demand
test landscape queries. All commands accept `--format` to switch between
`markdown` (default) and `json` output.

```bash
npx vitest-agent-reporter status      # Per-project pass/fail state
npx vitest-agent-reporter coverage    # Coverage gap analysis
npx vitest-agent-reporter history     # Flaky/persistent failure trends
npx vitest-agent-reporter trends      # Coverage trajectory over time
npx vitest-agent-reporter doctor      # Database health diagnostic
npx vitest-agent-reporter cache path  # Print the database file path
npx vitest-agent-reporter cache clean # Delete the database
```

See [docs/cli.md](../docs/cli.md) for the full CLI reference.

## Migrating from 1.x

Version 2.0 introduces three changes worth knowing about before you
upgrade:

### Database location moved

The SQLite database moved from `node_modules/.vite/vitest/<hash>/vitest-agent-reporter/data.db`
to `$XDG_DATA_HOME/vitest-agent-reporter/<workspaceName>/data.db`.
**No data migration is performed** — your first 2.0 run starts with a
fresh database. Coverage baselines, trends, and history all reset.
Existing data in `node_modules` is harmless and ignored.

If you want the old project-local layout, set this in
`vitest-agent-reporter.config.toml` at your workspace root:

```toml
cacheDir = "./.vitest-agent-reporter"
```

### Package split (peers auto-install)

`vitest-agent-reporter` is now four packages — `vitest-agent-reporter`
itself (the Vitest plugin/reporter), `vitest-agent-reporter-shared`
(the shared library), `vitest-agent-reporter-cli` (the CLI bin), and
`vitest-agent-reporter-mcp` (the MCP server bin). The CLI and MCP
packages are required peer dependencies of the reporter, auto-installed
by pnpm and npm 7+. If your package manager skips peers, install them
explicitly. The `vitest-agent-reporter` and `vitest-agent-reporter-mcp`
bin names are unchanged.

### `AgentReporter.onInit` is now async

`onInit` now returns `Promise<void>` so it can resolve dbPath
asynchronously. Vitest awaits the hook, so `AgentPlugin` users see no
change. Direct callers of `onInit` must await the promise.

## Requirements

- Vitest >= 4.1.0
- Node.js >= 22
