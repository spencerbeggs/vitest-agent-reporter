/**
 * Public reporter contract for the vitest-agent plugin.
 *
 * The plugin owns persistence, classification, baselines, trends, and the
 * Vitest lifecycle wiring. The reporter is just the rendering stage: it
 * receives an assembled run (reports + classifications + trend context),
 * gets a kit of plugin-resolved primitives (env detection, OSC-8 helper,
 * resolved config), and returns `RenderedOutput[]` to be routed.
 *
 * A reporter is richer than a single Formatter — it can dispatch to multiple
 * formatters internally (e.g. a `GitHubReporter` emits SARIF for code
 * scanning AND markdown for the step summary). The return shape is
 * `RenderedOutput[]` so a single render call can produce multiple targets
 * with different content types.
 *

 * plugin always populates it in practice — the option exists for clarity
 * and to leave room for future "no-persistence" experiments.
 *
 * `format` and `detail` are pre-resolved by the plugin (via
 * `FormatSelector` / `DetailResolver`) but reporters that want to override
 * can ignore them. `noColor` is the resolved value of the `NO_COLOR` env
 * var; reporters use it to gate ANSI escapes and OSC-8 hyperlinks.
