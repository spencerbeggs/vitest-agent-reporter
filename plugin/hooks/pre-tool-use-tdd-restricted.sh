# PreToolUse hook for the tdd-task subagent — restricted MCP tools.
#
# Defense-in-depth for the tdd-task agent's `tools:` array. Even if the
# agent's tool registry drifts (or the agent attempts a tool not
# listed in its frontmatter), this hook explicitly denies destructive
# MCP calls so the safety property "tdd-task never deletes goals,
# behaviors, or its own evidence" stays load-bearing.
#
# Denied tools (matched on operation suffix; both bare and plugin-
# namespaced prefixes are accepted):
#   - tdd_goal_delete    — orchestrator must use status:'abandoned'
#   - tdd_behavior_delete — same
#   - tdd_artifact_record — D7 reserves artifact writes for hooks/CLI
#
# Non-orchestrator agents (main agent, other subagents) are unaffected
# and fall through to the standard permission flow. Delete tools are
# also intentionally omitted from `lib/safe-mcp-vitest-agent-ops.txt`,
# so the main agent surface still requires explicit user confirmation
# before a cascade-delete proceeds.
